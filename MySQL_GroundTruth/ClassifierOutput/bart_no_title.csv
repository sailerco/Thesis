Skills,"an authentication issue, the dreaded 420 response from the Twitter API, etc. If I could somehow be notified about the issue, then I could provide that information to my user so she could fix the issue or at least understand what is going on.  I've seen that the REST API will support an endpoint to check the current status of a stream, but it is not yet available and it would require my application to be polling constantly the stream, with all the disadvantages compared to a pushing mechanism.","h2. Narrative As an XD developer, I need to be able to create a composed job module as XML from the DSL an store it in the Module File repository.  While the user uses the composed job as if it is a normal job including seeing only the DSL.  In the background the JobFactory will deploy the composed job module.   * When the user destroys the job the module will be deleted from the file module repository. * When the user creates the job a module will be created in the file Module repository. h2. Back story For the composed job story, we need to create a """"real"""" job module to be expressed in XML, so that we can take advantage of the job execution tasklet in XD-3556, so that each job can be executed as a step in the composed job."
